Hey!

I'm going to go through Alex Allian's book "Jumping into C++" and 
because I'm so self centered I figured I would upload it all!
Grab the book and follow along if you'd like! You can find it here:
http://www.cprogramming.com/c++book/

I make absolutely zero promises about how long this will take me.
Maybe I'm just putting off studying for finals?!

This is going to be a super wild ride. Hopefully my uploading
this stuff is cool... if not let me know, and I'll take it all
down!

Examples in chapters are labeled as ch(chapter number)ex(example 
number).cpp while end of chapter problems are labeled ch(chapter
number)pr(problem number).cpp. A couple files I uploaded at the 
start don't follow this naming scheme.
