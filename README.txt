Hey!

I'm going to go through Alex Allian's book "Jumping into C++" and 
because I'm so self centered I figured I would upload it all!
Grab the book and follow along if you'd like! You can find it here:

I make absolutely zero promises about how long this will take me.
Maybe I'm just putting off studying for finals?!

This is going to be a super wild ride. Hopefully my uploading
this stuff is cool... if not let me know, and I'll take it all
down!
